Running the application prompts the user to input their login information (a username and password) in a login window or
sign up. Once the user log in the entity menu is displayed.
The sign up window looks like the login window. The user inputs a username and password, the program stores this login
information and then displays the entity menu.

In the entity menu, the user is able to choose whether they would like to play against a computer or another player. The
user is also able to see their Elo score from the entity menu.
If the user chooses to play against another player, a login screen is displayed for the other player to input their
login information or signup.
If the user chooses to play against a computer, the game automatically begins.
If different game modes are implemented in the future, they will be available in the entity menu.

The game contains the pieces (kings, queen, bishop, knight, rook, pawn) and rules of standard chess.
A user is able to input their move by clicking on a piece and moving it to the desired location. The board checks if
this move is legal, and then updates the board to show the move having been made if it is.

If the board is in a win or draw state, the match ends and the program displays the result. In a win state, the program
would display which player won. In a draw state, the program would display that the match ended in a draw.
If the match was against another player, the program then recalculates each playerâ€™s Elo rating to reflect the results
of the match.
The user is brought back to the entity menu.
